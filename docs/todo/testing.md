# Testing Plan

## Philosophy

No mocks. Every test runs against real infrastructure.

Vibespace is infrastructure-heavy software — subprocess calls, Kubernetes orchestration, WireGuard tunnels, daemon IPC, DNS servers. The bugs live in the integration, not the logic. Mocking the I/O gives green tests and false confidence. A mock can confirm you called `client.Create()` with the right args, but it can't tell you the Deployment spec is wrong, the label selector doesn't match, or the kubeconfig path breaks on one platform.

Instead, we test at two levels:
1. **Pure logic tests** — call Go functions directly with real inputs, assert real outputs. No I/O, no infra needed.
2. **Real infrastructure tests** — run the actual `vibespace` binary against real k3s clusters, real WireGuard tunnels, real VMs. Same as a user would.

### When to reconsider

Add interfaces and mocks if/when:
- A second contributor can't run integration tests locally
- CI times exceed 15 minutes and need a fast-path
- CLI handlers grow complex enough to warrant isolated testing

None of these apply today.

## Test Tiers

### Tier 1: Pure logic (no I/O, no infra)

77 tests across 17 files. Packages: `pkg/errors`, `pkg/agent`, `pkg/vibespace` (validation), `pkg/ui`, `pkg/session`, `pkg/remote`, `pkg/dns`, `pkg/daemon/protocol`, `internal/platform`, `internal/cli` (output). All run with `-race` in ~3s.

### Tier 2: K8s service layer

10 tests across 2 files (`pkg/vibespace/service_test.go`, `pkg/deployment/manager_test.go`). CRUD against real k3s installed directly on the CI runner. Pods stay `Pending` (busybox image) but Deployment specs, labels, Services, PVCs, and Secrets are validated.

### Tier 3: Full binary lifecycle (E2E)

~25 subtests per platform, testing the entire CLI stack as a subprocess.

| Platform | Runner | Build tag |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Bare metal (k3s) | GitHub ubuntu-latest | `e2e && linux` |
| Colima (macOS) | Self-hosted macos-m2 | `e2e && darwin` |
| Lima + QEMU | Self-hosted linux-hub | `e2e && lima` |

Subtest flow:
```
init → status → create → list → agents →
  info → config-show-all → config-show → config-set → config-verify →
  session-list → wait-for-ready →
  agent-create → agent-list-two → agent-delete → agent-list-one →
  exec → forward-list-empty → forward-add → forward-list-active →
  forward-remove → ports → multi-list-sessions → multi-list-agents →
  multi-message → stop → start →
delete → verify-deleted
```

## CI Pipeline

### Every push — `ci.yml` (3 parallel jobs)

```
ci.yml (every push)
  ├── lint          (~30s)  — go vet, staticcheck, deadcode, gofmt
  ├── unit          (~30s)  — go test -short -race (pure logic only)
  └── integration   (~2min) — k3s install + go test -race (all tests)
```

### Push to main + PRs to main — `ci-e2e.yml` (3 parallel jobs)

```
ci-e2e.yml
  ├── baremetal     (~5min)  — ubuntu-latest, init --bare-metal
  ├── colima        (~8min)  — macos-m2 (self-hosted)
  └── lima          (~10min) — linux-hub (self-hosted, KVM)
```

## Coverage

Standard `go test -cover` only measures lines inside the test process. E2E tests run the binary as a subprocess, so CLI handlers show 0% without binary coverage.

**Solution:** Build with `go build -cover`, set `GOCOVERDIR`, merge unit + E2E profiles.

5 Codecov flags with carryforward:
- `unit` — `go test -short -coverprofile` (every push)
- `integration` — `go test -coverprofile` with k3s (every push)
- `e2e-baremetal` — binary coverage on ubuntu-latest
- `e2e-colima` — binary coverage on macos-m2
- `e2e-lima` — binary coverage on linux-hub

---

## Self-Hosted Runners

| Label | Machine | Use |
|-------|---------|-----|
| `macos-m2` | Mac Mini M2 | Colima E2E tests |
| `linux-hub` | Home Linux PC (i5-3470S, 16GB, KVM) | Lima E2E tests |

## What's Next

1. **Expanded E2E subtests** — ~25 subtests covering info, config, exec, forward, ports, multi, stop, start (this PR)
2. **Remote mode E2E (Step 8)** — WireGuard tunnel tests: `vibespace serve` on VPS, `remote connect` from runners
